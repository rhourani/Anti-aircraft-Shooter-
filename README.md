# Anti-aircraft-Shooter

Using PictureBox and a list components togather to make a whole Aircraft and Shoots/Bullets lists in one enviroment, After collecting all of this lists and put them in the pictureBox we start to applicate some tricks to elieminate the aircraft and the bullet when they hit each other.

its good to mention too the way that i used for creating the attacking aircrafts that came from space,

As an X & Y Cordinates; We have our screen that is looks likes this:


(0,0)
****************************************************************** >> X = some random digit
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
* Y= -11

-----------------------------------------------------------


so by creating our attacking aircraft in the plus Coordinates of Y and X randomly, and looping the Y & X by subtract 1 in every loop we can have the aircrafts as if its comes from no where!
